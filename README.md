# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze user behavior and preferences based on three datasets UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails. By exploring these datasets, we can gain valuable insights into user engagement, dish preferences, and order patterns.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Handle missing values and inconsistencies in the data.
Merge the datasets based on relevant columns.

2. User Behavior Analysis:
Calculate user engagement metrics (e.g., total sessions, average session duration).
Analyze user preferences based on meal type, dish, and time of day.

3. Cooking Session Analysis:
Analyze session duration and rating distributions.
Identify popular dishes and their associated ratings.
Analyze the relationship between session duration and rating.

4. Order Trend Analysis:
Analyze order frequency and amount.
Identify popular dishes and their sales performance.

5. Relationship between Cooking Sessions and Orders:
Identify factors influencing user order decisions.

6. Data Visualization:
Use appropriate visualizations to represent key findings.
Create visualizations to compare dish preferences by age group, location, and meal type.
